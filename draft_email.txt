Subject: Re: Inquiry about Camera Availability

Dear John Doe,

Thank you for your email.  Unfortunately, the Canon EOS C300 Mark III is currently not available for rental. 

However, we do have other similar cameras available, such as the Canon EOS C200, which is available for $250/day, and the Sony FX6, which is available for $300/day. 

Please let me know if you would like to learn more about these cameras or if you have any further questions. 

Best regards,

Atri
